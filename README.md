============

*Course Project for CS-520:*

Investigated the Thompson problem of uniformly distributing points onto the surface of a hypersphere.

**Thompson Problem:**

The objective of the Thomson problem is to determine the minimum electrostatic potential energy configuration of N electrons constrained to the surface of a unit sphere that repel each other with a force given by Coulomb's law. This can be easily formulated as an optimization problem of uniformly distributing points onto the surface of a hypersphere.

In this project, we study the effects of using various optimization approaches to solving this problem with high N (data points a.k.a electrons) and high D (dimensions).

Note: Code uses the Poblano Matlab toolbox from https://software.sandia.gov/trac/poblano.
